### Prices Policy

The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time prior to accepting an Order.

The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the event of any occurrence affecting delivery caused by government action, variation in customs duties, increased shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs, and any other matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, you will have the right to cancel your Order.

### Payments

All Services purchased are subject to a one-time payment per monthly or yearly subscription period. Payment can be made through various payment methods we have available, such as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express cards via Stripe.

Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by your card issuer. If we do not receive the required authorization, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of your order.

### Subscription Period

The Services, or some Services, are available only with a paid subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly or annually), depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing the subscription.

At the end of each period, your subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or the company cancels it.

### Subscription Cancellations

You may cancel your subscription renewal either through your account settings page or by contacting the company. You will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for your current subscription period, and you will be able to access the service until the end of your current subscription period.

**Early Cancellation**: You may choose to cancel your subscription early at your convenience provided that we will not provide any refunds of prepaid fees or unused subscription fees, and you will promptly pay all unpaid fees due through the end of the subscription term.

### Billing

You shall provide the company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

You will keep your contact information, billing information, and credit card information (where applicable) up to date. Changes may be made on your Billing Page within your account. All payment obligations are non-cancellable and all amounts paid are non-refundable, except as specifically provided for in this agreement. All fees are due and payable in advance throughout the subscription term. If you purchase on behalf of a client, you agree to be responsible for the Order Form and to guarantee payment of all fees.

### Fee Changes

The company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current subscription period.

The company will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the service after the subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.

### Refunds

Except when required by law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.

Certain refund requests for subscriptions may be considered by the company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the company.

### Free Trial

The company may, at its sole discretion, offer a subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time.

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the free trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for a free trial, you will not be charged by the company until the free trial has expired. On the last day of the free trial period, unless you canceled your subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription fees for the type of subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, the company reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the free trial offer, or (ii) cancel such free trial offer.
