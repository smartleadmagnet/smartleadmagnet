# How to Use the SmartLead Magnet API

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the SmartLead Magnet API to manage your lead magnets programmatically.

## Authorization

To interact with the API, you'll need to generate an API key.

### Generating an API Key

1. **Sign in to Your SmartLead Magnet Account**

   - Go to [SmartLead Magnet](https://smartleadmagnet.com/) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to API Settings**

   - Click on your profile avatar or name to open the user menu.
   - Select **Settings** or **API Keys** from the dropdown menu.
   - Alternatively, go directly to [API Key Management](https://smartleadmagnet.com/settings/manage-keys).

3. **Create a New API Key**

   - Click on **Generate New Key**.
   - Give your API key a descriptive name (e.g., "My App Integration").
   - Click **Create** to generate the key.
   - **Important:** Copy the API key and store it securely. You won't be able to view it again.

### Using the API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Example in JavaScript:**

```js
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${yourApiKey}`,
}
```

## Making a Request

To use one of your lead magnets via the API, send a POST request to:

```
https://smartleadmagnet.com/api/leadmagnet
```

### Request Headers

Include the following headers in your request:

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

### Request Body

In the request body, include:

- **`id`**: The ID of the lead magnet you want to use.
- **Key-value pairs** for each input field required by your lead magnet.

### Obtaining the Lead Magnet ID and API Schema

1. **Go to Your Lead Magnets**

- Navigate to [SmartLead Magnet Managed Keys](https://smartleadmagnet.com/settings/manage-keys).

2. **Get the Lead Magnet ID and Schema**

- Find the lead magnet you want to use.
- Click on the **Action** menu (usually represented by three dots).
- Select **Get API Schema** or **View Details**.
- Note the **`id`** field in the schema; this is your lead magnet's unique ID.
- Review the schema to understand the required input fields.

### Example Request Body

Here's an example of what your JSON request body might look like:

```json
{
  "id": "6704013026e9b885593bfsss",
  "text": "Sample Paragraph",
  "color": "#000000",
  "email": "test@smartleadmagnet.com"
}
```

## Full Example Request

Here's how you might structure a full API request using JavaScript (e.g., with `fetch` or `axios`):

```js
const axios = require('axios');

const apiUrl = 'https://smartleadmagnet.com/api/leadmagnet';
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your actual API key

const data = {
  id: '6704013026e9b885593bfsss', // Replace with your lead magnet ID
  text: 'Sample Paragraph',
  color: '#000000',
  email: 'test@smartleadmagnet.com',
};

axios
  .post(apiUrl, data, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    },
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log('Success:', response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
  });
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you generated and `id` with your actual lead magnet ID.

## Handling the Response

Upon a successful request, the API will return a response containing:

- **Status Code**: `200 OK`
- **Data**: Any data returned by the lead magnet, such as confirmation messages or lead details.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Lead magnet processed successfully.",
  "data": {
    "leadId": "abc123xyz",
    "email": "test@smartleadmagnet.com",
    "status": "subscribed"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

If there's an error with your request, the API will return an error response. Common errors include:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Your API key is missing or invalid.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request body is malformed or missing required fields.
- **404 Not Found**: The lead magnet ID does not exist.

**Example Error Response:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid API key."
}
```

### Tips for Error Handling

- **Check Response Codes**: Always check the HTTP status code of the response.
- **Validate Input Data**: Ensure all required fields are included and correctly formatted.
- **Secure Storage**: Keep your API key secure and do not expose it in client-side code.
