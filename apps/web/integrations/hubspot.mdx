# How to Add Smart Lead Magnet to Your HubSpot Website

**Note:** You'll need administrative access to your HubSpot account to complete these steps.

## 1. Log in to Your HubSpot Account

Go to [HubSpot Login](https://app.hubspot.com/login) and enter your credentials to access your account dashboard.

## 2. Navigate to Your Website Pages

- In the main navigation menu, click on **Marketing**.
- Select **Website** and then choose **Website Pages** (or **Landing Pages** if you prefer).

## 3. Create a New Page or Edit an Existing One

- Click **Create** to start a new page, or
- Find an existing page where you want to embed Smart Lead Magnet and click **Edit**.

## 4. Add a Custom HTML Module to Your Page

- In the page editor, click on **Add** in the left sidebar to insert a new module.
- Search for **Custom HTML** in the module list.
- Drag and drop the **Custom HTML** module into the desired location on your page.

## 5. Paste the Smart Lead Magnet iFrame Code

In the **Custom HTML** module:

- Click on the module to edit its content.
- Paste the following iFrame code into the editor:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://Smart Leadmagnet.com/share/{{magentid}}" width="100%"
      height="600"
      style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
      max-width: 100%;
      height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
      min-height: 500px;"
      loading="lazy"
      referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
      allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
  ></iframe>
  ```

**Important:** Replace `{{magentid}}` with your unique Smart Lead Magnet ID. For example:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://Smart Leadmagnet.com/share/your-unique-id" width="100%"
      height="600"
      style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
      max-width: 100%;
      height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
      min-height: 500px;"
      loading="lazy"
      referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
      allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
  ></iframe>
  ```

## 6. Preview and Publish Your Page

- Click **Preview** to see how the page looks with the embedded Smart Lead Magnet.
- If everything appears correctly, click **Publish** (or **Update**) to make your changes live.

## 7. Test the Embedded Smart Lead Magnet

- Visit the live page on your website to ensure the Smart Lead Magnet is functioning properly.
- Interact with the embedded content to verify that it's capturing leads as expected.

**Note:** If the iframe doesn't display correctly, ensure that your HubSpot settings allow for embedded content and that there are no security settings blocking iframes from external sources.
