# How to Add Smart Lead Magnet to Your Wix Website

**Note:** You'll need administrative access to your Wix account to complete these steps.

## 1. Log in to Your Wix Account

- Go to [Wix.com](https://www.wix.com/) and click on **Sign In**.
- Enter your email and password to access your Wix dashboard.

## 2. Open Your Website Editor

- From your dashboard, locate the website you want to edit.
- Click on **Select & Edit Site** to open the Wix Editor.

## 3. Navigate to the Desired Page

- In the Wix Editor, use the **Pages** menu at the top to select the page where you want to embed the Smart Lead Magnet.

## 4. Add an HTML Embed Element

- Click on the **Add** (âž•) button on the left-hand side menu.
- Hover over **Embed Code**, then click on **Embed HTML**.

## 5. Place the HTML Embed Element on Your Page

- Drag the **HTML Embed** box to the location on the page where you want the Smart Lead Magnet to appear.
- Resize the box as needed by dragging its edges.

## 6. Enter the Smart Lead Magnet iFrame Code

- Click on the **Enter Code** button inside the HTML Embed box.
- In the code window that appears, paste the following iFrame code:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/{{magentid}}" width="100%"
      height="600"
      style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
      max-width: 100%;
      height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
      min-height: 500px;"
      loading="lazy"
      referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
      allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
  ></iframe>
  ```

**Important:** Replace `{{magentid}}` with your unique Smart Lead Magnet ID. For example:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/your-unique-id" width="100%"
      height="600"
      style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
      max-width: 100%;
      height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
      min-height: 500px;"
      loading="lazy"
      referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
      allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
  ></iframe>
  ```

- Click **Apply** to save the code.

## 7. Adjust the HTML Embed Box

- Ensure the HTML Embed box is large enough to display the Smart Lead Magnet without scrollbars.
- You can adjust the size by clicking and dragging the corners of the box.

## 8. Preview and Publish Your Site

- Click on **Preview** at the top right to see how the Smart Lead Magnet looks on your page.
- If everything appears correctly, click **Publish** to make the changes live on your website.

## 9. Test the Embedded Smart Lead Magnet

- Visit your live website to ensure the Smart Lead Magnet is functioning properly.
- Interact with the embedded content to verify that it's capturing leads as expected.

**Note:** If the iframe doesn't display correctly, check your Wix settings to ensure that embedding external content is allowed, and there are no restrictions blocking iframes.
