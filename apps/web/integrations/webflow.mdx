# How to Add Smart Lead Magnet to Your Webflow Website

**Note:** You'll need administrative access to your Webflow account to complete these steps.

## 1. Log in to Your Webflow Account

- Go to [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) and click on **Log In**.
- Enter your email and password to access your Webflow dashboard.

## 2. Open Your Project

- From your dashboard, select the project where you want to embed the Smart Lead Magnet.

## 3. Access the Designer

- Click on **Designer** to open the Webflow Designer for your project.

## 4. Navigate to the Desired Page

- In the **Pages** panel on the left, select the page where you want to add the Smart Lead Magnet.

## 5. Add an Embed Element to Your Page

- In the left toolbar, click on the **Add Elements** button (the **+** icon).
- Scroll down to the **Components** section.
- Drag the **Embed** component onto your page and place it where you want the Smart Lead Magnet to appear.

## 6. Insert the Smart Lead Magnet iFrame Code

- Click on the **Embed** element you just added.
- In the **Embed Code Editor** that appears, paste the following iFrame code:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/{{magentid}}" width="100%"
      height="600"
      style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
      max-width: 100%;
      height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
      min-height: 500px;"
      loading="lazy"
      referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
      allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
  ></iframe>
  ```

**Important:** Replace `{{magentid}}` with your unique Smart Lead Magnet ID. For example:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/your-unique-id" width="100%"
      height="600"
      style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
      max-width: 100%;
      height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
      min-height: 500px;"
      loading="lazy"
      referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
      allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
  ></iframe>
  ```

- Click **Save & Close** to apply the code.

## 7. Adjust the Embed Element Size (If Necessary)

- Ensure the Embed element is sized appropriately to display the Smart Lead Magnet without scrollbars.
- You can adjust the size by selecting the Embed element and modifying its width and height in the **Style** panel on the right.

## 8. Publish Your Website

- Click on the **Publish** button in the top right corner.
- Choose **Publish to Selected Domains** to make your changes live.

## 9. Test the Embedded Smart Lead Magnet

- Visit your live website to ensure the Smart Lead Magnet is displaying and functioning correctly.
- Interact with the embedded content to verify that it's capturing leads as expected.

**Note:** If the iframe doesn't display properly, ensure that your Webflow project settings allow for embedded code and that there are no security settings blocking external iframes.
