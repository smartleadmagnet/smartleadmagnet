- Enter your email and password to access your Squarespace dashboard.

## 2. Navigate to the Page Where You Want to Embed Smart Lead Magnet

## 5. Enter the Smart Lead Magnet iFrame Code

- In the **Code Block** editor:
- Make sure the **Display Source** option is unchecked.
- Set the **Type** to **HTML**.
- Paste the following iFrame code into the editor:

```html
<iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/{{magentid}}" width="100%"
    height="600"
    style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
    min-height: 500px;"
    loading="lazy"
    referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
    allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
></iframe>
```

**Important:** Replace `{{magentid}}` with your unique Smart Lead Magnet ID. For example:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/your-unique-id" width="100%"
      height="600"
      style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
      max-width: 100%;
      height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
      min-height: 500px;"
      loading="lazy"
      referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"

  ></iframe>
```

## 6. Save Your Changes

## 7. Preview and Test the Embedded Smart Lead Magnet

- Navigate to the live page on your website to ensure the Smart Lead Magnet is displaying correctly.
- Interact with the embedded content to verify that it's functioning as expected.

**Note:** If the iframe doesn't display properly, ensure that your Squarespace settings allow embedded code and there are no security settings blocking external iframes.
