# How to Add Smart Lead Magnet to Your Shopify Store

**Note:** You'll need administrative access to your Shopify store to complete these steps.

## 1. Log in to Your Shopify Admin Dashboard

Go to your Shopify admin page by visiting `https://your-store-name.myshopify.com/admin`.

## 2. Create a New Page or Edit an Existing One

- From the left-hand menu, click on **Online Store**, then select **Pages**.
- Click **Add page** to create a new page, or click on an existing page to edit it.

## 3. Enter a Title for Your Page

Give your page a title in the **Title** field, such as "Smart Lead Magnet".

## 4. Switch to HTML Editor

- In the **Content** section, click on the **Show HTML** button (it looks like `<>`) in the rich text editor toolbar. This will allow you to add HTML code directly.

## 5. Paste the Smart Lead Magnet iFrame Code

Copy the following iFrame code and paste it into the HTML editor:

```html
<iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/{{magentid}}" width="100%"
    height="600"
    style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
    min-height: 500px;"
    loading="lazy"
    referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
    allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
></iframe>
```

**Important:** Replace `{{magentid}}` with your unique Smart Lead Magnet ID. For example:

```html
<iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/your-unique-id" width="100%"
    height="600"
    style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
    min-height: 500px;"
    loading="lazy"
    referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"
    allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
></iframe>
```

## 6. Save Your Changes

- Click **Save** at the top right corner to save your page.

## 7. Add the Page to Your Navigation (Optional)

If you want customers to access this page from your store's navigation menu:

- Go to **Online Store** > **Navigation**.
- Select the menu where you want to add the page (e.g., **Main menu**).
- Click **Add menu item**.
- Enter a **Name** for the menu item.
- In the **Link** field, select **Pages** and choose the page you just created.
- Click **Add** and then **Save Menu**.

## 8. Preview Your Page

- Go back to **Online Store** > **Pages**.
- Find your page and click **View** to see how it looks on your store.

Your Smart Lead Magnet should now be embedded and visible on your Shopify store page, ready to engage your visitors.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues with the iframe not displaying correctly, make sure that your store's theme allows embedded content and that there are no restrictions blocking iframes.
